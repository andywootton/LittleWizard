The (little) Wizard Book - a software spelling guide

This repository will contain information (and maybe spells) for the purpose of inspiring young software wizards.

I was asked to help children learn to code but I felt I could add more value by making more children want to.

An eBook will be published for free use in education. If anyone wants to produce a printed book version, without compromising that commitment then please get in touch.

'The Wizard Book' is an undergraduate text book for engineering students at MIT. 'The (little) Wizard Book' is an attempt to translate the magic on the first page of the original for a younger audience who already want to be wizards, to help them see that software is a  realistic way to achieve their ambition.
